Hi! 

I'm Allan and I enjoy building things in software, and the art and craft of building things better.

I also enjoy thinking about & prototyping new ways of interacting with software -- what I refer to as UI design (as opposed to changing the color of a button to see if CTR increases)...

Enjoy the posts, if I and when ever do!

Allan
